    Happy birthday to the prettiest, most beautiful, and precious creation of God! I've known you for about 4 years now, and nary a day went by without a thought about you.
<br><br>
I love how goofy and silly you can be, but somehow, you always know when, where, and how to say the right stuff. It has been an absolute delight watching you grow into the woman that you are today, and it excites me beyond comprehension for what the future holds for you. It is going to be great things and then some more. Needless to say, I will always and always be there for you, yk obsessively. ðŸ˜­ I can't wait to meet you someday! ðŸ˜­ From the countless late-night conversations to the shared victories and bonding over trauma, I will always cherish your unwavering presence in my life.
<br><br>
I love you so, so, so much, ika. Of all the things that hhas happened to me you'll always be my favourite. Words cannot express my adoration for you and how grateful I am for your presence and existence. Here's to another year of you blessing the world and blessing my life. Once again, happy, happy birthday, my sweet angel! ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—
